# ShipMusic

A simple mod that adds some music (that you can set yourself!) to the ship to play at all times, even in the worst situations you've ever been in!

## Installation, configuration.
- Installation is done by either using the Thunderstore Mod Manager (or r2modman), or it can be done manually by pressing the "Manual Download" button on the thunderstore page of the mod, and then dropping the mod folder inside the ```BepInEx/plugins``` folder. The config file will be made on the first game startup with the mod enabled.
- To configure the mod you can use either the Config editor provided by Thunderstore Mod Manager (alternatively r2modman) or you can access the ```command.ShipMusic.cfg``` file made by the mod in ```BepInEx/config```, and change the values from there.

## Mod Configs
Currently there are only three config settings for the mod, those being:
- Sound Volume (which controls the volume of the set music)
- Max Distance (which controls the maximum distance at which you can still hear the set music)
- Sound Filter (which adds a "radio" filter to the set music, for aesthetic purposes)

The SoundVolume and MaxDistance can be updated in-game, however you have to rejoin a lobby if you want to turn off (or on) the sound filter while you're in-game
